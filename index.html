    <h1>Walking Through a Mystical Forest</h1>
    <p>This is me walking through a forest on a horse trail. However, things get 
        magical because I begin to see creatures from the wizarding world. There's 
        an owl flying to pick up the mail it needs to deliver. On the ground, there's
        a few Bowtruckles walking around and a niffler just enjoying the money and jewels
        it just acquired.
